# MuSES: Music genre Suggestion with EnSemble learning

This is a kick-off for the project. We focus on music genre classification, which is a crucial problem for music recommender systems.

- Python version: Python 2.7
- Library used: 
	- For data manipulation and visualization: Numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib
	- For learning and prediction: Scikit-learn, xgboost


We will evaluate through various learning models for the task. Planned models to use:
- Baseline models: Softmax regression, Decision tree
- Advanced models: SVM kernel RBF, Neural Network
- **Ensemble models**: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) and ExtraTrees (Extremely Randomized Trees)

To be updated...
